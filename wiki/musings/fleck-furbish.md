#  Overview

A compact mathematical representation of Point-Cloud in vicinity of every speck is essential to approximation of the region by smooth surface, error correction and smoothening.

## `Speck`

Speck is a gross approximation of Point-Cloud in a leaf-level  `Cell`     with coordinates $\bold{\vec{P}_{i,j, k}}$.  Here the indices $\bold{_{i,j, k}}$ refer to it dimn-badges.

The point-cloud is assumed to be a sampling of potential field around the Body. The Body under investigation coincides with the equi-potential piecwise smooth manifold of an underly field $\bold{\phi} (x, y, z)$. Or rather the equi-potential surface with value **0**. 

The density of points is propotional to the deviation of sampled location from the solutions of manifold equation.

$$\bold{\phi} (x, y, z) = 0 $$

In less abstract terms, we could consider a plane. a plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far and is embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidian space.

$$x_{1,2} = {-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}.$$

$$|\vec{A}|=\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2}.$$(1)

$$P_\omega={n_\omega\over 2}\hbar\omega\,{1+R\over 1-v^2}\int\limits_{-1}^{1}dx\,(x-v)|x-v|,$$

Who hasn't heard of $E=mc^2$?

This is another inline expression:
$\vec{F} = \frac{d \vec{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = m \vec{a}$
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

$$ \sum_{\substack{ 0<i<m \ 0<j<n }} P(i,j) $$

$$
\sum_{\substack{
   0<i<m \\
   0<j<n
  }} 
 P(i,j)
